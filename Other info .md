### Competitive electronics –
Do try out the electronics competitions held in other iits . Our iit (iit bhu) has pretty good electronics culture , since Ive observed that other iits do not have a separate competitions for all different domains of electronics ) Most competitions focus on digisim and continuum level material , and sometimes Arduino hackathons are held which are pretty easy . 
### Toolkit u might wanna try as a student – 
Proteus , Orcad , EagleCAD , MATLAB , Simulink , Arduino , Xilinx Vivado , Icarus 

### Project Guidance - 
Basic projects like Digisim and Ichip projects will definitely help and are worth doing . Do participate in udyam . Apart from that , focus on building real life engineering skills by solving real life problems that come to your mind using innovative and new ways (innovation is always a plus point in a project , copying a project from youtubhe does not make it ur work , even interviewer would know that this method already exists ) . Enhance ur tech stack by learning more and more tech related stuff . Attend workshops and competitions held in other iit techfests . Being a coder does not make u a real life engineer , solving problems using tech does .
