Paper - 
The paper consisted of 21 questions , all of them were 
fill in the blanks type , and there was negative marking 
(so that people cant guess) . Few questions on registers ,
counters , 1 on binary search , 1 on DFS (Depth First 
Search) , Verilog , Puzzles (2 trains opp direction , same
direction time given vaala) , 2 questions on STA . 

Overall the electronics questions werent that hard tho 
what was surprising was presence of few basic dsa questions
so I advice everyone to have a rough idea of that too .
Puzzles were easy but bit time consuming 

Most core peeps managed to solve about 14-15 , I solved 16
, 1 guy did 17 . My screen froze for about 7 min in a 50 
min paper , so always be mentally prepared to not panic
and get back into action when the screen freeze ends (
hope that dosent happen with you tho ) 

Interview - 

Interview was held in noon . Only one round , online , 1 hr .
was the first interview for the day
The interview started with internet connection problem 
(lol pretty much routine for me ) which I fixed by switching 
network xd .
Then the introduction (ratt ke jaana ) 
then they wanted to talk about projects , and gave me an
option on which one I wanted to discuss . I confidently said
as they wish ( recommended when u did all ur projects , not
recommended when ur projects are stolen ones xd) 
They went forward to discuss my first project VOCMEF (
voice controlled mecanum based forklift ) , I shared them 
the screen , showed them the cad model pictures on my 
github , explained them the underlying mechatronic model .

Then the interviewer suddenly started going deeper into the 
ML model part (unexpected in a core interview , but was well 
prepared for it since I had prepared for all 3 profiles 
core , ml/datasci , sde ) . The interviewer then claimed 
that he could calculate the correlation something for 2 
voices using digital signal processing and ml model was 
unneccessary , to which I replied that I hadnt studied 
Digital comms that much in depth and appreciated his method 
(personally feel appreciating is a good way to defend when 
interviewr has better answer than you ) .
 Then he asked me why did
I use hamming code specifically to which I said cool lag raha tha 
(ps : ye nahi karna tha , thankfully noone laughed or joked about it) .
 Then he asked for the learning from the project to which 
I initially replied no learning and received stare but then defended by 
adding all my learnings like how I learnt hamming code 
from commnet , arduino from xiota , double wishbone 
suspension and cad from sae , X jack lifter from mechatronics
etc 
 ( ps : ratt ke 
jaana ye to , maine nahi kiya but defend ho gaya sahi se bass )

Then they switched to digital electronics and gave a diagram 
with 2 registers and gates to do any boolean operation I 
want , and wanted me to replace the 2 numbers (obvio , xor se 
hoga , basic coding q jaisa hua , but insert drama of thinking 
logically and arriving to the answer so that interviewer dosent 
think that u learnt this q ) 

Then they opened my test paper , analyzed it ( yeah ye unexpected tha)
and asked me why I left few questions , to which I replied 
that my screen froze , and I understood that the paper was time 
constrained so attempted the shorter questions first . 

Then they gave me a question that a mod 3 , mod 4  and mod 5
counter were cascaded and input freq given , find output 
freq , I did not understand the question but kept asking clarifyign 
questions , then realised they asking very simple 1/3 x 1/4 x 1/5 
of original freq , and also explained them what I was 
thinking initially which mislead me .

Then a simple puzzle that a bank, entry and exit fee 1000 
but money doubles inside , person goes in and out 3 times
and ends up with 1000 rupees , find initial amount , 
very easy puzzle , solved it while explaining it to them . 

Overall they were asking questions on the topics which 
I had left in the paper so that they could assess me better 
(happened with everyone , like some people were asked verilog 
but I wasnt probably cause I did al correct in paper ) 

Then entered deep into STA , first asked me to explain setup 
and hold time violations which I did easily . Then took 
the quesrtion from the paper itself which I had skipped due to 
lack of time and asked me to find critical path . I did not 
know what critical path is and so they explained me what it is 
and then I immidiately found it and explained the optimisations 
required in the ciruit . Then they went even deeper and asked me if 
I knew STA equatrions , to which I said no , and they left the 
STA topic ( phew , didnt expect sta to be asked in depth ) 

Finally they asked me if I have any questions for them 
and I asked them about projects which will be assigned to us 
(obvio preplanned q ) . Then the interviewer told me that I was 
very quick with catching hints and probelm solving , and 
interview ended on a positive note .
