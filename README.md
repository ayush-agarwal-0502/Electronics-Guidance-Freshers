# Electronics-Guidance-Freshers
Guidance about material for core electronics freshers 

### Electronics – 
Topics division according to ur needs –

Wanna do Basic electronics – digital electronics , analog electronics , Verilog

Bare essentials for intern season , rest of the things mostly prepared at end 2-3 months usually – digital , Verilog 

Wanna prep for interns – digital , Verilog , cmos , sta, asic soc , comp arch (in order of importance)

Wanna study for fun – basic electronics + pcb design , arduino + digital comms

### Digital electronics – 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1LYo3hxGXUEa5EB4T_3jryEYxIUDbvV0

Digisim + Funckit videos (watch from youtube udyam channel ) + course me kuch extra lage to cover kar lena + neso if u have any topic related doubts 
Book is mano morris (has depth of theory and questions , but yeah I didn’t do full) 
### Verilog (RTL Coding ) –
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1LYo3hxGXUE9GYwQl1XQ8i0MvIUwNu1v

ICHIP from udyam youtube , and uski PS kar lo . 
Can also practice Verilog on site – hdlbits , it’s a bit like coding platforms like hackerrank, cf, cc for Verilog , except that questions are limited , just do it

https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Problem_sets

At best they ask to make a register or counter in interview , so atleast that much prep needed 
### CMOS – 
Don’t need to go into full depth and characteristics and stuff , just need to understand how to make digital circuits and gates using it .

Can see this one till dynamic cmos , baaki thoda interviewer pe bhi rehta hai to which u say that it wasn’t taught to you yet 
### STA – 
Static Timing analysis . Was one of the least important topics upto my year , but in my year almost everyone asked questions on it , be it test or interviews 
Should understand basic setup and hold time violations , critical path determination , and some numericals practice would be nice (which I didn’t do )

This seemed good enough to me 
### Comp Arch – 
Least asked topic from exam point of view 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I5ZMmrOfnA&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&index=8

This will give the rough idea of cu , alu , memory , buses and stuff , baaki can see gatesmashers or nandtotetris too , but pretty much overkill 
### ASIC , SOC – 
Not a topic they really expect you to know , but helps to know what kind of work is done in industry , just try and grasp the basic idea of how a pcb is made , and what an ASIC intern does (which will be ur job title )

### Arduino (not for exams , but asked in competitions , pretty fun part ) – 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1LYo3hxGXUFW7713cs8UwRPJ4bHS80aP

https://docs.arduino.cc/
Do try building stuff , gives you basic understanding of mechatronics and IoT concepts 
### PCB Design (not for exams) – 
https://www.udemy.com/course/pcb-design-with-eagle/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=rl2xnKiLcHs&ranSiteID=rl2xnKiLcHs-u2t9V5T8cnE3KlkdE540Mg&LSNPUBID=rl2xnKiLcHs&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads

Amit Rana Udemy course Eaglecad one 
Just watch the free part and learn the rest from youtube . Hope that our college develops a culture of pcb design too and it becomes an event in udyam 
### Power electronics (will be needed if u apply for power electronics profile )  -
Watch simulim event workshops , which is a part of prastuti , eee dept fest iit bhu , their workshops are not available on youtube so cant share link 
### Digital comms ( not needed for tests ) – 
Commnet workshops dekhlo -

### Analog profile ( if u apply ) –

Plus course related stuff
